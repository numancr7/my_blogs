## Introduction to React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently.

### Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- **Declarative Syntax:** Describe what your UI should look like, and React will handle the rest.
- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```
